# algorithmas

My personal blog site made purely from html/css/js (i.e without using any frameworks). The website is mainly static (with very few dynamic elements). 

The only non-obvious file is **markdownArticlesToHTML.py**, which is a python script to convert the **.md** articles (**markdown files**) to HTML (since there are quite a few of elements that would be really time consuming to write without using something of the sorts of markdown).
