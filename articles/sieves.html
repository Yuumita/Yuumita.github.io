</ul>
<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Sometimes it's easy to count things, I believe even toddlers can count. What's hard is to not over or under count. 
Thankfully mistakes can be fixed, and calculations recalibrated, that's the core idea of Sieving. 
We can do this by carefully deleting elements from the set we count, by overcounting and then removing duplicates, counting the contribution indirectly and the list goes on.</p>
<p>In this article we will present the most important sieves. In that way it can also act as an introduction to Sieve theory.</p>
<h3 id="Notation">Notation</h3>
<ul>
<li>$[n] = \{1,\dots, n\}$, for $n\in\mathbb{N}$</li>
<li>$\textbf{1}[P]$ is $1$ if $P$ is true, else it is $0$</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Sieve of Eratosthenes">Sieve of Eratosthenes</h3>
<p>Eratosthenes, a Greek polymath, wanted to count the primes up to $n$. 
He found the first prime, $2$, and then thought of deleting every multiple of $2$ since every multiple wouldn't be a prime. 
The next smallest number was $3$, a prime, he then deleted every multiple of $3$. 
The next smallest number not deleted was $5$, also a prime, he then realized that if there was a number before $5$ and after $3$ it couldn't contain a prime factor greater than $3$, and since he had deleted all numbers with prime factors not greater than $3$ he was sure $5$ was prime.</p>
<p>The above observation led to the straightforward algorithm for finding primes up to $n$. </p>
<div class="box"><pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-cpp">int n;
int is_prime[n+1];
void prime_sieve(){

    for(int i = 0; i &lt= n; i++) is_prime[i] = true;
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false;

    for (int i = 2; i &lt= n; i++) {
        if (is_prime[i] && (long long)i * i &lt= n) {
            for (int j = i * i; j &lt= n; j += i)
                is_prime[j] = false;
        }
    }

}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Notice that we start deleting all multiples of a prime $p$ from $p^2$, this is because a non-prime number of the form $pk$ (with $k &lt; p$) has a prime factor not greater than $k &lt; p$. 
It's obvious that the running time is $O(n\log n)$, however the bound can be imported to $O(n\log \log n)$, but we won't prove it since it goes out of the scope of the article. 
Perhaps the reader can try to do so. It is not hard, supposing knowledge of some well known facts.</p>
<h4 id="Factorizing numbers in $O(\log n)$">Factorizing numbers in $O(\log n)$</h4>
<p>With a bit more thought, Sieve of Eratosthenes not only shows us which elements get deleted, and therefore are not prime, but it also shows by which primes they get deleted. 
In other words, when having deleted all of multiplied of $2$ and we go to $3$, $6$ won't get deleted by $3$ since it was already deleted by $2$. 
This implies the following algorithm for computing the SPF (smallest prime factor) of all numbers up to $n$ in $O(n\log\log n)$. It's useful to pretend that the SPF of $1$ is $1$.</p>
<div class="box"><pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-cpp">int n;
int spf[n + 1]; 
void prime_sieve() {

    for(int i = 1; i &lt= n; i++) spf[i] = i; 
    for(int i = 2; i &lt= n; i += 2) spf[i] = 2;

    for(int i = 3; i &lt= n; i += 2) if(spf[i] == i) {
        for(long long j = (long long)i*i; j &lt= n; j += i){
            if(spf[j] == j)
                spf[j] = i;
        }
    }

}
</code></pre></div>

<p>This precomputation is extremely useful because it allows us to factorize a number $x\in[1, n]$ in $O(\log n)$ by continiously dividing the number with the SPF, if the SPF is $1$ (i.e it doesn't have any primes) the factorization is done.</p>
<div class="box"><pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-cpp">vector&ltint&gt get_factorazation(int x) {
    vector&ltint&gt ret;
    while(x &gt 1) {
        ret.push_back(spf[x]);
        x /= spf[x];
    }
    return ret;
}
</code></pre></div>

<h4 id="Linear Sieve">Linear Sieve</h4>
<p>Let's try to optimize the previous sieve. In the Sieve of Eratosthenes we try to mark/delete a number $k$ once for every prime factor of $k$. What if we find a way to do it only once?</p>
<p>Let $spf[i]$ be the smallest prime factor of $i$. We will try to gradually compute $spf$ by iterating through numbers $x=2,3\dots n$. When are at $x$ we will compute $spf[x]$ and all $spf[y]$ for $y = p \cdot x$ for some prime $p \leq spf[x]$. Say we are at $x$ there are two cases to computing $spf[x]$</p>
<ul>
<li>$x$ is prime, in such a case we set $spf[x] = x$. This will happen when $spf[x]=0$ (unmarked) when we first iterate through $x$.</li>
<li>$x$ is composite, in such a case $spf[x] &lt; x$ and $x = spf[x] \cdot d$ for some $d$ with $spf[d] \geq spf[x]$ and we will have already computed $spf[x]$ when we were at the number $spf[x]$.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, after having computed $spf[x]$ we need to iterate through all primes $p \leq spf[x]$ and compute $spf$ of $y=p\cdot x$ as $spf[y] = spf[p\cdot x] = p$.</p>
<p>This is correct because the decomposition of $y$ as $y=p\cdot x$ for the prime $p$ with $p \leq spf[x]$ is unique, since it is basically the decomposition $y = spf[y]\cdot \frac{y}{spf[y]}$ (and obviously $spf\left[ \frac{y}{spf[y]} \right] \geq spf[y]$ by definition of $spf$.</p>
<div class="box"><pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-cpp">vector&ltint&gt spf(n+1, 0);
vector&ltint&gt primes;

void linear_sieve() {
    for(int i = 2; i &lt= n; i++) {
        if(spf[i] == 0) { // unmarked so i is a prime
            spf[i] = i;
            primes.push_back(i);    
        }

        for(int j = 0; i * primes[j] &lt= N && primes[j] &lt= spf[i]; j++) {
            spf[i * primes[j]] = primes[j];
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Therefore we have a prime sieve in $[1, n]$ that runs in $O(n)$. Let's now dive to more math-heavy sieves.</p>
<h3 id="The Sieve Formula">The Sieve Formula</h3>
<p>The sieve formula, or what's generally called PIE (Principle of Inclusion Exclusion) has many forms. 
There are a lot of sources to many of these forms, but we are going to present a less used variation. A probabilistic one. 
We will later see how it is similar to the standard form.</p>
<h4 id="Probabilistic Sieve Formula">Probabilistic Sieve Formula</h4>
<p>Let $A_1,\dots A_n$ be arbitrary events of a probability space $(\Omega, P)$. For each $I\subseteq [n]$ (here $[n] = \{1,\dots, n\}$) let
$$ A_I = \bigcap_{i\in I} A_i;\ \ A_{\emptyset} = \Omega\ .$$
Then 
$$P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right) = \sum_{j = 1}^n (-1)^{j-1} \sum_{I\subseteq [n]\atop |I|=j} P(A_J) 
= \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq [n]}(-1)^{|J|-1} P\left(\bigcap_{j\in J} A_j\right)\ .\quad (1)$$ </p>
<p>It can be proved by induction, but that's boring. What we will want to do is count the contribution of each atom to each of the two sides. 
Recall from measure theory that an atom is a set of positive measure which contains no set of smaller positive measure.
Unfortunately, not all probability spaces can be decomposed to such atoms in a way that the sum of their measures equals $1$.</p>
<p>Instead let's focus on pseudo-atoms, or more specifically the atoms of the Boolean algebra generated by $A_1,\dots, A_n$. 
For a set $I\subseteq [n]$ let's define the event
$$ B_I = \left(\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i\right) \cap \left(\bigcap_{i\not\in I} \overline{A_i}\right)$$
as the event in which the events $I$ happen, and the events $[n]\setminus I$ don't. <br>
Now the probability of any combination of events $A_i$ can be decomposed to the sum of some $B_I$. </p>
<p>Let's fix $I$ and say it has $k$ elements ($|I|=k$). Then $P(B_I)$ is counted in the left hand side of $(1)$ if and only if $k&gt;0$, else it is not counted. <br>
As for the right side, it is counted with a coefficient $(-1)^{|J|-1}$ for the sets $\emptyset \neq J\subseteq I$. 
For $|J| = j$ there are $\binom{|I|}{|J|} = \binom{k}{j}$ such sets. 
Therefore the final coefficient of $P(B_I)$ in the right hand side is
$$ \sum_{j=1}^k \binom{k}{j}(-1)^{j-1} = 1-\sum_{j=0}^k \binom{k}{j}(-1)^{j} = 1 - (1 - 1)^k = \textbf{1}[k \neq 0]\ .$$
Therefore again $P(B_I)$ is counted exactly once if and only if $k&gt;0$, else it is not counted. <br>
Therefore we have proven $(1)$.</p>
<h4 id="Set Theoretic Sieve Formula">Set Theoretic Sieve Formula</h4>
<p>Let $A_1,\dots, A_n\subseteq S$ where $S$ is a finite set, and let 
$$ A_I = \bigcap_{i\in I} A_i;\ \ A_{\emptyset} = S\ .$$
Then
$$\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right| = \sum_{j = 1}^n (-1)^{j-1} \sum_{I\subseteq [n]\atop |I|=j} |A_J| = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq [n]}(-1)^{|J|-1} \left|\bigcap_{j\in J} A_j\right|\ .\quad (2)$$ </p>
<p>This is the more standard form of the Sieve formula. We can easily make the transition from $(1)$ to $(2)$. 
Indeed suppose we choose $x\in S$ uniformly and represent $A_i$ as the event for which $x\in A_i$, then
$$P(A_i) = \frac{|A_i|}{|S|}\ .$$
From $(1)$ we get
$$\frac{\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right|}{|S|} = \sum_{j = 1}^n (-1)^{j-1} \sum_{I\subseteq [n]\atop |I|=j} \frac{|A_J|}{|S|} = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq [n]}(-1)^{|J|-1} \frac{\left|\bigcap_{j\in J} A_j\right|}{|S|}$$ 
from which $(2)$ easily follows by multiplying with $|S|$. From this we can see that $(1)$ is $(2)$ but normalized, i.e we shrink the set $S$ to $\Omega$ while keeping the realative measures.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Sieve formula is written as follows (but we omit the proof)
$$\left|S \setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right| = \sum_{J\subseteq [n]}(-1)^{|J|}|A_J|\ .\quad (3)$$</p>
<h3 id="Mobius Inversion Formula">Mobius Inversion Formula</h3>
<p>Let $(V,\leq)$ be a countable poset (partially oredered set) and let $f$ be any function defined in $V$ and set
$$g(x) = \sum_{z\leq x}f(z)\ .$$ 
Then there exists a function $\mu$ defined in $V\times V$ such that
$$f(x) = \sum_{z\leq x}g(z)\mu(z, x)\ .$$
This function is the Mobius function defined on that poset. We have to take things a step back to achieve the result.
A curious reader might want to see why a function satisfying
$$\sum_{y\leq z\leq x}\mu(z, x) = \textbf{1}[y = x],\quad y \leq x\quad (4)$$
suffices.</p>
<h4 id="Incidence Algebra">Incidence Algebra</h4>
<p>For two functions $f$, $g$ defined on $V\times V$ (the finite invervals of $V$) we are going to define their convolution as 
$$(f*g)(x, y) = \sum_{x\leq z\leq y}f(x, z)g(z, y)$$
This definition has some similarities with matrix multiplication in the incidence algebra 
$$\mathbb{A}(V) = \{a\in \mathbb{F}^{V\times V}\ |\ x&gt;y \implies a(x,y) = 0\}$$
for which the multiplication of elements is just the convolution defined above, but for clarity we are still going to call it convolution.</p>
<p>Now let us define some functions in $\mathbb{A}(V)$. Namely $\zeta$ and $\delta$, which are defined as follows 
$$\zeta(x, y) = \textbf{1}[x \leq y] \quad \quad \delta(x, y) = \textbf{1}[x = y]\ .$$
Those definitions are important because now $(4)$ can be written as 
$$(\zeta*\mu)(y, x) = \delta(y, x)\quad (4.1)$$
i.e $\mu$ should be the convolution inverse of $\zeta$.</p>
<p>Obviously then $\mu(x, x) = 1$ and, since $\mu\in\mathbb{A}(V)$, $\mu(y, x) = 0$ for $y &gt; x$.
Now what about $\mu(x, y),\  x &lt; y$ ? From $(4.1)$ we get
$$\sum_{x \leq z \leq y}\mu(z, y) = 0 \iff \mu(x, y) = - \sum_{x &lt; z\leq y}\mu(z, y)$$
and this allows us to compute $\mu$. 
Specifically to compute $\mu(x, y)$ with $x\leq y$ we fix $y\in V$ and set $\mu(y, y) := 1$ and then we sequentially compute going down from the order using the formula
$$\mu(x, y) = - \sum_{x &lt; z\leq y}\mu(z, y)\ .$$
More often we define $\mu$ by (for $x &lt; z$)
$$\sum_{x \leq y \leq z}\mu(x, y) = 0 \iff \mu(x, z) = -\sum_{x\leq y &lt; z}\mu(x, y)$$
but by the fact that $f * g = g * f$ (the convolution is communicative) we get that $\mu\zeta = \zeta\mu$ which leads to our result.</p>
<h4 id="Proof of the Mobius Inversion Formula">Proof of the Mobius Inversion Formula</h4>
<p>The proof of the formula is now trivial. Suppose that for the functions $f$, $g$ (defined on $V$, do not confuse them with elements of $\mathbb{A}(V)$) we have 
$$g(x) = \sum_{z\leq x}f(z)\ .$$
Now
$$\begin{align}
    \sum_{z\leq x}g(z)\mu(z, x) 
    &amp;= \sum_{z\leq x}\left(\sum_{y\leq z}f(y)\right)\mu(z,x) \\
    &amp;= \sum_{y\leq z\leq x}f(y)\mu(z,x) \\
    &amp;= \sum_{y\leq x}f(y) \sum_{y\leq z\leq x}\mu(z,x) \\
    &amp;= \sum_{y\leq x}f(y) \delta (y, x) \\
    &amp;= f(x)\ .\quad \blacksquare \\
\end{align}$$</p>
<h3 id="The Mobius function in number theory">The Mobius function in number theory</h3>
<p>The general Mobius function for arbitrary posets might be useful, especially for studying the properties of the function, but generally one would see the function in a number theory context.</p>
<h4 id="Definition">Definition</h4>
<p>The Mobius function is most commonly used in the poset $(\mathbb{Z^+}, \ |\ )$ (division on the positive integers). 
Then, it is mostly useful to restrict the function on only one dimension, i.e set $\mu(n) := \mu(1, n)$ (the $2$-dimensional function is like we defined previously).
Now $\mu$ should satisfy 
$$\sum_{d\ |\ n}\mu(d) = \mathbf{1}[n = 1]\ .$$
A more common definition is 
$$\mu(n) =\left\{\begin{array}{ll}0, &amp;\text{if $n$ has one or more repeated prime factors} \\ (-1)^k &amp;\text{if $n$ is a square-free positve integer with $k$ distinct prime factors}\end{array}\right. $$
The equivalence can be proved in a lot of ways, but we won't care about it. Besides, the first definition allows us to compute $\mu$ for the numbers $[N]$ in $O(N\log \log N)$ with $\mu(1):=1$ and 
$$\mu(n) := -\sum_{d\ |\ n\atop d\neq n}\mu(d),\quad n &gt; 1$$
with some careful computation order that is given below.</p>
<div class="box"><pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-cpp">    int N;
    int mu[N + 1]; // mu is initialized to 0
    void compute_mu() {
        mu[1] = 1;
        for(int d = 1; d &lt= N; d++) {
            for(int n = d + d; n &lt= N; n += d) {
                mu[n] -= mu[d];
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre></div>

<p>In case you didn't notice, this is again the Sieve of Eratosthenes (what a cool guy).  However keep in mind that it can also be computed with a linear sieve (refer to the solution in the last problem of the article).</p>
<h4 id="Applications of the number theoretic Mobius function">Applications of the number theoretic Mobius function</h4>
<p>Obviously the number theoretic Mobius function helps us with the inversion 
$$g(n) = \sum_{d\ |\ n}f(d) \iff f(n) = \sum_{d\ |\ n}g(d)\mu\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)$$
which is usually written as 
$$g = 1 * f\iff f = \mu * g$$
where 
$$(f*g)(n) = (g * f)(n) = \sum_{d\ |\ n}g(n)f\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)\ .$$</p>
<p>In case the read is confused about the $\mu(n/d)$ it might help to try to prove the formula themselves. 
As for the intuition, let's look at the general formula for posets
$$g(x) = \sum_{z\leq x}f(z)\iff f(x) = \sum_{z\leq x}g(z)\mu(z, x)$$
in the poset $(\mathbb{Z}^+,\ |\ )$ that would be 
$$g(x) = \sum_{z\ |\ x}f(z)\iff f(x) = \sum_{z\ |\ x}g(z)\mu(z, x)\ = \sum_{z\ |\ x}g(z)\mu\left(\frac{x}{z}\right)\ .$$
Where we observed, since $\mu(1, k) =\mu(k)$, that $\mu(d, kd) = \mu(k)$. 
That's because, as we saw previously the value of $\mu(x, z)$ depends only on the structure of the interval $\{y\ |\ x \leq y \leq z\}$ (the poset interval, not the standard one),
and on $(\mathbb{Z}^+, \ |\ )$ $[d, kd]$ is isomorphic to $[1, k]$.</p>
<p>However the inverison is usually hidden. The general strategy is to try and show $\mu$ from wherever we can. Let's consider the following problem</p>
<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> Count the number of co-prime pairs in $[1, N]$.</p>
<details class="- note">
<summary>Solution</summary>
<p>$$\begin{align} 
\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \textbf{1}[\gcd(i, j) = 1]
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{d\ |\gcd(i, j)}\mu(d) \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{d}\textbf{1}[d\ |\ \gcd(i,j)]\mu(d) \\
&amp;= \sum_{d}\mu(d) \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \textbf{1}[d\ |\ \gcd(i,j)] \\
&amp;= \sum_{d}\mu(d) \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \textbf{1}[d\ |\ i\ ,\ d\ |\ j] \\
&amp;= \sum_{d}\mu(d) \sum_{i'=1}^{\lfloor n/d\rfloor} \sum_{j'=1}^{\lfloor n/d\rfloor} \textbf{1}[d\ |\ i'd\ ,\ d\ |\ j'd] \\
&amp;= \sum_{d}\mu(d) \sum_{i'=1}^{\lfloor n/d\rfloor} \sum_{j'=1}^{\lfloor n/d\rfloor} 1\\
&amp;= \sum_{d=1}^n\mu(d) \left\lfloor \frac{n}{d} \right\rfloor^2\\
\end{align} $$
The last formula enables us to solve the problem in $O(n)$. </p>
